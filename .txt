PORTFOLIO BLURB
This is a brief portfolio of my work. I love different styles of tattooing & I am open to working on a range of subject matter for my tattoo artwork. I normally work mainly in a realistic style, especially if tattooing animals, or portraits. Then I often like to include some bolder elements, which is why I consider myself more of a mixed style tattoo artist. I also like to switch styles occasionally, so if you have an idea in a different style, get in touch & we can discuss possibilities.
