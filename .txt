Filling out the contact form
For new bookings I ask if you could please send the following information. If you are unsure of anything right now, no problem!

– Rough size/placement

– Style (realistic, outlined or mix)

– Black/grey or colour

– Any images (if anything is relevant) – forward to my email stevek.tatoo@gmail.com

– Your availability (days/times) for booking either the tattoo or a consultation, if needed.

Thats just to get a clear idea of what you’d like before I create your artwork. Before drawing I’ll send details to pay a deposit, which will be deducted from the price of the tattoo.

If you are ready to book, or have questions for me – You can contact me using my – contact form.

Booking Terms
– A deposit will be required to book an appointment, or to start working on artwork. All deposits are non refundable, in the case of a tattoo not being booked. They cover all of my time planning & communicating with you.

– Deposits are between $100-500 depending on size of the tattoo.

– I offer to change a drawing once. Any extra drawing time may incur charges. Once a drawing is approved there may be no more changes.

– Your deposit will be deducted from your final tattoo appointment. 

Cancelations, or changes to dates with less than two weeks notice will result in losing your deposit. Cancellations due to emergency situations may be re-scheduled.

Please arrive at the exact time of your appointment. If you are more than 15 mins late without contacting me you will lose your deposit & may be required to rebook your appointment & pay a new deposit.

Tattoo appointments must be booked within one month of receiving artwork, or three months from date of last appointment. Otherwise this will result in loss of deposit & a new deposit will be required.

All artwork remains the property of Steve Kretz & may not be used or copied by another artist. If you decide not to get the tattoo, then artwork can be reposted as available. The deposit covers my time preparing for your appointment & is not a purchase of artwork.
